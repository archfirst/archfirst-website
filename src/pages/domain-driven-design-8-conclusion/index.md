## Summary

-   Use _Domain-Driven Design_ to collaborate among all project disciplines and clearly understand the business requirements.
-   Establish a _Ubiquitous Language_ to discuss domain related concepts.
-   Use _Bounded Contexts_ to break down complex domains into manageable parts.
-   Use _Command-Query Separation_ to simplify your designs and improve performance.
-   Implement a _Layered Architecture_ to focus on different aspects of the application.
